# ROOM MAPPINGS
# ============================================================================
# Each [[mappings]] section defines how rooms with a specific prefix are styled.
#
# Fields:
#   prefix    - Room code prefix to match (e.g., "MA" matches MA1, MA2, MA3, etc.)
#               Case-sensitive. Longer prefixes take precedence (MA1 > MA).
#   bg_color  - Background color (hex) for timetable cell and map highlight
#               Example: "#fcdcd8" (light pink)
#   fg_color  - Foreground/text color (hex) for class code labels
#               Example: "#f0503f" (darker red)
#               Optional - defaults to "#231f20" (dark gray) if omitted
#   map_id    - SVG element ID in your school map file to highlight
#               Must match 'id' or 'data-name' attribute in map SVG
#   label     - Human-readable department name for reference
#               Optional - used in logs and future features
