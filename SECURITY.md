# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The latest commit on `main` and the most recent tagged release receive security fixes. Older tags may be patched on a best-effort basis if the fix is low risk.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please report it privately so we can address it quickly:

1. Email **richard@richard-slater.co.uk** with the subject line `SECURITY: <short summary>`.
2. Include the steps required to reproduce the issue and any proof-of-concept materials.
3. Do **not** open a public GitHub issue for security-sensitive problems.

You will receive an acknowledgement within 72 hours. Once the issue is validated, we will:

- Work with you on a fix and target release timeline.
- Credit you in the release notes if desired.

Thank you for helping keep Bromcom Timetable Formatter safe for everyone.
